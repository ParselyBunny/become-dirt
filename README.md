# Become Dirt

> Become Dirt is a PSX-style 2.5D exploration horror game originally developed as part of the 2022 TGD Spooky Jam! A young girl arrives home one day to find her home strangely quiet and her brother is unresponsive when she calls his name. Perhaps, she thinks, he's down in their hideout in the crawl space. Perhaps, she considers, he's hiding from their mother and grandmother. Perhaps, she realizes too late, he may have used the family's forbidden spell... and now he has no way to break it on his own.
