It was easier for them than sweeping dirt from the kitchen floor. Now we only have three spells left.","\n","^My grandmother knows them all - She learned them when she was young and practiced every day to keep them clear in her mind. She told me, before I was old enough to understand, that it was her responsibility to make sure we didn't lose the last of our magic.","\n","^Normally my mother would be the one to teach us, but she can't do magic at all. She never could. I heard that when I was born, my grandmother was overjoyed and nearly cracked a smile as she held me.","\n","^She could tell I had the talent for magic, but even with all the lessons she gave me I could only ever use the most useless of our family's spells. Become Dirt - the spell that makes you worthless.","\n","^My younger brother is better at it than me - Magic, that is. He learned our family's strongest spell without any trouble.","\n","^Become Mechanical, the spell my grandmother used to work beyond her own limits and raise a daughter on her own without ever breaking or slowing down. He's a really smart kid, and he's a lot more responsible than I ever was.","\n","^Recently, though, he's been afraid of something. I don't know what he's worried about, but he always seems anxious and uneasy these days.","\n","^My grandmother wants to make sure he knew all the family's magic so that he can pass it on one day, and he's been making great progress.
