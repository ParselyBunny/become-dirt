She told me, before I was old enough to understand, that it was her responsibility to make sure we didn't lose the last of our magic.","\n","^Normally my mother would be the one to teach us, but she can't do magic at all.

I don't know what he's worried about, but he always seems anxious and uneasy these days.","\n","^My grandmother wants to make sure he knew all the family's magic so that he can pass it on one day, and he's been making great progress.

Every time you look at yourself, you're surrounded by little bits of toothpaste, water mixed with soap from washing our hands and faces, and a few smudges I don't want to really think about. We clean it, of course, but a lot of these stains won't come off anymore.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Sink":["^We just unclogged it last week so it finally drains alright.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Toilet":["^The fluffy cover on the toilet lid always stares back at me before I lift it.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"BathTub":["^My sitting place.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"BunkBed":["^The bunk bed where my brother and I sleep. The bottom bunk is his, since I kept banging my head on the top bunk when I used to sleep down there.","\n","^He asked me to switch one day, saying he was scared of heights and wanted to be closer to the ground. I'm pretty sure he was just being considerate.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"SisterBooks":["^Ah. My Biology textbook... I need it for homework but brother left one of the magic tomes on top of it.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Dresser":["^When I was seven I ruined my dresser with glitter stickers, so now the handles are covered in sticky dust and gunk.","\n","^I thought I learned a really valuable lesson the day Mom yelled at me and made me scrape the stickers off one by one, but yesterday I scratched the varnish trying to open the top drawer.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"SiblingDesk":["^Two of grandma's old magic books are laid out on top of [Brother]'s homework.","\n","^None of us can use the spells in most of her old books, but she makes him study all of them anyway.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"OpenTome":["^Two of grandma's old magic books are laid out on top of [Brother]'s homework.","\n","^None of us can use the spells in most of her old books, but she makes him study all of them anyway.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"PaperTrash":["^What...is this?","\n","^These strange icospheres on the ground, is this wax? Or some sort of soft stone used in a ritual? They seem like — oh.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"PaperTrash2":["^It's my homework from last week. It got crumbled up in the bottom of my backpack.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Dragonology":["^Oh, my copy of 'Dragonology' is back here. I loved that book when I was my brother's age, but it's a little disheartening to think about how expensive it would be to actually see a Dragon.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Poster":["^A poster I got from the school book fair for reading all of 'Where the Red Fern Grows'. I didn't really like it much but the poster's nice.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Wardrobe":["^I need to fold my clothes right. I don't have that many pairs of jeans but they barely fit in my side because I never fold them.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"MomDoor":["^I can hear Mom watching The Young & The Restless through the door. Cricket died again, I think.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Television":["^Mom watches TV here after dinner and sometimes my brother and I watch things early in the morning on weekends though we can't make too much noise. It's hard to hear unless we sit close and his neck starts to cramp when he has to look up for so long.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"EntertainmentCenter":["^I remember when we carried this home. Someone left it out by a dumpster a few years ago and Mom had me help her carry it back. It had some kind of bug living in it, so now it smells like bug spray and cologne.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Fireplace":["^It's dangerous for the fireplace to be lit when no one's watching it. I'm watching it right now, though, so it's safe.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"BrotherSetting1":["^My brother's setting at the table. I don't remember when we both started sitting side by side all the way on this end. It's just how we've always done things.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"BrotherSetting2":["^There are old crayon marks on the edge of the table here.

Last time she got mad at me for dumping her coffee, but last week she told me I shouldn't just leave old mugs lying around if I see them when I do dishes.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"GrandmaSetting":["^Our Grandma's seat at the table. She uses it like a desk when she teaches my little brother magic.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"TopShelf":["^The top shelf is full of reference books that Mom got at a yard sale. A lot of the encyclopedia sets are missing volumes, but I did use a couple of these for school once.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"MiddleShelves":["^Most of the bookcase is full of used paperbacks and discards from the library.

Not by us - we almost never use them anymore. Someone else wore the springs down and ripped the cushion.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Sofa2":["^Creaky and comfy.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Armchair":["^Mom's Armchair. She sits here and drinks her coffee after dinner almost every night.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"LivingRug":["^Sometimes, when I'm tired, I'll come in here and stare at this rug to space out. The pattern looks like it starts moving after a while, like watching a popcorn ceiling through fan blades.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"WashDryer":["^Our dryer, and our wet-er.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"LintBucket":["^Mom's lint bucket. She uses this for her plushies.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Paul1":["^It's a creature with the head of a stuffed bird and the body of a mysteriously decapitated stuffed lion, I think. My mom named it Paul.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Paul2":["^I think there's styrofoam in his legs. That's what keeps him standing upright, and also why he sounds so awful when he moves.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"PlushieGuts":["^I wish there was an easy way to clean plushie guts. This pile alone took me two days and I can still see bits of granola in it.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"HuskedBear":["^Mom keeps saying she's going to stuff this bear and dress her up like a ballerina.

I'm not sure when any of us used them last, since I got in trouble for trying to use it to make a yogurt Santa when I was younger.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"KitchenSink":["^Fruit Flies... do they live down there? Is there a world where they're happy at the bottom of the sink drain?","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Freezer":["^I'm supposed to chip away the ice in here so we can get to the steaks Mom got on sale a few months ago. I lost the knife sharpener though and it's too dangerous to use anything else.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Plates":["^Six nice plates for potatoes with chives, I dropped one last week and then there were five.","\n","^...Sorry.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"DiningTableCandles":["^The lights over the dining table are a lot brighter but my grandma says candlelight is better for reading because it's less strain on the eyes.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"OpenBooks":["^My grandma always reads our family's old magic books at the table. It's where she teaches my little brother, too.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"OpenBooksGround":["^Why are these on the ground?
