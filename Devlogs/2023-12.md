In terms of specific things I think the main points are
- Loads of new 3D assets
- New Title Theme song
- CRAWLSPACE
- Here's some before and after images to show how far we've come since the prototype
- Demo is still planned for soon: We don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we'd have to crunch to get it out, but we're really close and so playing Become Dirt will be possible before long

Anything else you want to add as well about what we're doing next could be good but I think those are the major points I'd want to hit!

# Demo Progress Update!

Before we get into the more exciting news, I wanna talk about some of the stuff we've been working on here at home~

## That Fresh Old Paint Smell
After the last demo we definitely wanted to take some time to improve the mustiness of everything, that old girl (the house) deserved it!

We upgraded our rendering pipeline, added some *moodier lighting*, and cooked up plenty of bits and bobs that make it all feel more lived-in.

> *Speaking of lived-in, we're adding a new area to the game: the Crawlspace! No preview images just yet for all you spry fans out there, but you can keep an eye out in the future (grins).*

There's also been some much desired updates to the UI and the systems surrounding it. It's all so crunchy now, I love it.

Keep an ear or few out for new sounds and music tracks too! We love listening to Dirt as much as the rest of youse.

## Now, what you've all been waiting for...

**New demo release is still planned for "soon"!**

*In the wise words of Team Organizer slash dirt-mouthfeel-appreciator Runa:*
> "We don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we'd have to crunch to get it out, but we're really close and so playing Become Dirt will be possible before long"

Wise words indeed, so true. The only crunch I wanna experience lies in the mulches of the mind.

## Oh and, one more thing..

Last, but not least, a small introduction with a big shoutouts to Vivi ([@vivi-avi](https://avianalick.wixsite.com/eyes-in-the-dark/portfolio)) and Jane ([@bluebstopcat](https://bluebstophat.itch.io/)) who joined us since the last release! Vivi helping us with the endless relics we want in this 3-dimensions of a house and Jane with all those swanky UI updates with some additional help in our code pipes. Welcome to the team :)

Exciting excited yes yes!! Can't wait to show more and more Dirt as the \<insert units of time> continue on. Hope to speak with everyone again soon!
